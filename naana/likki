vijay kumar my naana
hes the person who makes my childhood memorable more than now ( now its different )
I love him or not i dont know - but feeling of not loving my dad hurts me
in my childhood he ran behind my school bus just to give me my snacks ( some biscuits from our shop )
he ran behind my school bus shouting to stop the bus and he will try to insert 2 rupee coin from windows so that i can buy chocolates in school
I have most unforgettable memories with my dad ( we both together laughs until our stomach hurts , cheeks get pain and with tears in eyes )
